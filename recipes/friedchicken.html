    <h2>Make amazing fried chicken using this recipe!</h2>
    <h3>The fried chicken is golden brown and crispy on the outside, with a crunchy, seasoned crust that’s packed with flavors like garlic, onion, and a hint of smokiness from the paprika. The coating is thick and slightly crunchy, while the inside of the chicken is juicy, tender, and perfectly cooked through. When you bite into it, the skin cracks satisfyingly, revealing moist, flavorful meat that's been marinated and sealed with the crispy exterior. The seasoning is balanced—salty with a slight kick from the cayenne, and it’s just the right amount of seasoning to complement the rich, savory chicken. It's that ideal mix of crispy and tender, savory and slightly spicy, making each bite irresistibly good!</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li>4 chicken pieces (legs, thighs, or breasts)</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 cup buttermilk (or substitute with regular milk and 1 tablespoon vinegar)</li>
    <li>2 cups of Vegetable oil</li>
    <h2>Steps to Make:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat the chicken pieces dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper. Let it sit while you prepare the flour mixture.</li>
        <li>In a shallow bowl, combine the flour, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>In another shallow bowl, pour the buttermilk.</li>
        <li>Dip each piece of chicken first into the buttermilk, making sure it's well-coated.</li>
        <li>Then, dredge it in the seasoned flour, pressing lightly so it sticks. Make sure it's evenly coated.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or deep pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. You’ll want about 1 to 2 inches of oil in the pan.
        To test if the oil is hot enough, drop a small bit of flour into it. If it sizzles immediately, it's ready.</li>

        <li>Carefully add the chicken pieces to the hot oil, skin-side down if you're using bone-in pieces.</li>
        <li>Fry for about 10-12 minutes on each side, turning occasionally until the chicken is golden brown and crispy. (Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature – it should be 165°F or 74°C.)</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is cooked through, transfer it to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</li>
        <li>Let it rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
